# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

I used APIs to collect weather data from 500+ cities world wide based off of 2,000 randomly generated latitude-longitude coordinates, locating the cities on those coordinates and ignoring coordinates that did not produce cities. I created a searchable database of those cities, allowing users to filter it based on weather temperture preferences. I utilized gmaps to find hotel information from the filtered database and created a travel itinerary between selected hotels in four cities.
